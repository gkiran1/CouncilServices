<b>THIRD PARTY APPS</b>
<br>
For your convenience, this App may contain links to Apps operated by others. These Apps are not maintained or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for their content.

      <h1 class="concil-about-sub-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to be a general statement that describes how we collect, use, and process personal
        information you provide on our App (referred to as “App”). We strive to collect, use, and disclose personal information
        in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we collect personal information. This Privacy Policy
        applies to this App, which is owned and operated by the Councils Foundation.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Information Collection</b>
        <br> When you create a Councils we may collect or obtain from you your name, address, e-mail address, phone number,
        photo, contact or profile preferences, and Church unit information.<br> 
        We may also collect information your internet
        device or web browser sends whenever you visit the App including an Internet Protocol address.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Use of Personal Information</b>
        <br> We may use the personal information you provide to (a) allow us to contact you, (b) fulfill requests you make,
        (c) seek your voluntary feedback on website features or content, or (d) help fulfill our mission.<br>
        We may also use your personal information for internal purposes, including auditing, data analysis, system troubleshooting, and research.<br>
        In addition, we may use both the personal information you provided and the information your web browser sends (see
        section 10 below) in order to detect users who appear to be causing harm to our sites or in order to personalize
        users’ experiences on our sites.<br> If your information will be used for any purpose besides those outlined above, we
        will specifically inform you and obtain your consent, if legally required.<br> From time to time, we may also make you
        aware of options to opt out of using or opt in to use certain features.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Content Submissions</b>
        <br> On some of our sites you may provide your own content and comments in selected areas. Some of your submissions
        are intended to be private and not viewable by others. We recommend that you use caution when providing content intended
        to be viewed publically and that you avoid posting information that could cause harm or injury, or risk of harm or
        injury, to yourself or others.<br> All types of content submissions you provide will be stored either on our systems
        or the systems. While industry standards are used to safeguard your submissions from unauthorized access, disclosure,
        or modification we cannot guarantee complete privacy and we may, in some instances, choose or be legally required
        to disclose such information to third parties.<br> Though we are under no obligation to monitor your content submissions,
        we reserve the right to do so at our sole discretion. We also reserve the right to block or remove any content we
        deem inappropriate, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing, defamatory, libelous, tortious, illegal,
        threatening, or otherwise objectionable, regardless of whether it was intended to be private or public. Since we
        do not review all content submitted through every feature on every site, we cannot guarantee that we will be able
        to take protective measures in the event you provide content disclosing information about a person who is a victim
        of harm or abuse or is at risk of becoming a victim of harm or abuse.<br> When we become aware of content that we consider
        to be offensive or that could compromise the privacy of your personal or confidential information or that of another
        person, we will make a good-faith effort to block or remove such content.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Retention</b>
        <br> We retain collected information and submissions for 60 days then delete it from our records.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Access</b>
        <br> We endeavor to maintain the accuracy of personal information and rely on you to ensure your personal information
        is complete and accurate. You may verify, correct, or remove your personal information through your website-specific
        registration, through your profile, or through your LDS Account, where applicable.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b>
        <br> We regard your personal information as confidential and do not sell it to anyone. We do not share your personal
        information with other parties except in the following circumstances:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Third-Party Providers</b>
        <br> We may provide personal information to third parties for their use in performing internal functions on our behalf;
        payment processing, maintenance, security, data analysis, hosting, etc.. In such instances, the providers will be
        contractually required to protect personal information from additional in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
        industry standards.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Church Entities</b>
        <br> We may transfer personal information to any Church-affiliated entity to accomplish Church purposes. For membership
        information transfers from the European Union, we rely on standard clause agreements between Church entities in compliance
        with European Union requirements. For online submissions of personal information, we deem an individual’s submission
        to be an affirmative act, indicating informed consent to the processing of the data as well as informed consent to
        allow the transborder data transfer to the United States of America, where applicable, for the purposes for which
        it was provided.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Legal Requirements</b>
        <br> We may access and disclose your personal information, posts, journal entries, online chats, personal notes,
        content, or other submissions to any website if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required by a subpoena
        or other judicial or administrative order or otherwise required by law. Additionally, we may disclose your personal
        information and other information where we, in good faith, deem it appropriate or necessary to prevent a violation
        of our other agreements; to take precautions against liability; to protect the rights, property, or safety of the
        site, of any individual, or of the general public; to maintain and protect the security and integrity of our services
        or infrastructure; to protect ourselves and our services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate
        and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; or to assist government law enforcement agencies.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Protection of Information</b>
        <br> We use technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information we receive against loss, misuse,
        and unauthorized alteration and to protect its confidentiality. We regularly review our security procedures and consider
        appropriate new security technology and methods. We also use current encryption technology to encrypt the transmission
        of data on our log-in pages. However, because we cannot guarantee the complete security of these encryption technologies,
        please use caution when submitting personal information online.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Third-Party Data</b>
        <br> Where local law permits, you may submit personal information, including contact information about someone other
        than yourself to allow us to make contact with that person, make a delivery, or otherwise meet your request. The
        information collected will be used solely to facilitate your request. When providing personal information about anyone
        other than yourself, you must first obtain the other person’s informed consent if his or her consent is legally required.
        If you or someone else has provided us with your personal contact information and you would like to request that
        we do not contact you further, please follow the unsubscribe or opt-out procedures provided on the specific site,
        newsletter, e-mail notification, etc.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Passive Data Collection</b>
        <br> When you visit any of our sites, our servers or filtering systems may collect information that your web browser
        sends any time you visit a website. This information may include but is not limited to your browser type, your operating
        system, your language preference, any referring web page you were visiting before you came to our site, the date
        and time of each visitor request, and information you search for on our sites.<br>
        We also use cookies and clear GIFs
        to collect information. A cookie is a small bit of data used to transfer information to either your computer’s hard
        drive or your web browser for record-keeping purposes. A cookie serves as a sort of label that allows our sites to
        recognize your web browser when you return to our sites.  A clear GIF (also known as a web beacon) is used in combination
        with cookies to help us understand how visitors interact with our sites. A clear GIF is typically a transparent graphic
        image placed on a website. The use of clear GIFs allows us to monitor your actions when you open a web page and makes
        it easier for us to follow and record the activities of recognized browsers. For example, using clear GIFs, we can
        track the path of page visits on a website and monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our sites.<br> We collect
        this information to better understand how you use and interact with our sites in order to improve your experience.
        We may also share this information with our employees, contractors, service providers, and affiliated entities as
        defined in section 7.<br> You can change your web browser settings to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
        accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use some
        sections or functions of our sites.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Children's Privacy</b>
        <br> We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 on most of our sites. Any of our sites
        that collect children’s information will do so only with the prior express and informed consent of the child’s parent
        or guardian in compliance with applicable law. We strongly recommend that minors under the age of 18 ask their parents
        for permission before sending any personal information to anyone over the Internet, and we encourage parents to teach
        their children about safe Internet use practices.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Third-Party Links</b>
        <br> We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any third-party sites. For your own protection,
        you should review the policies of other sites to ensure they meet your personal privacy expectations.
